# Snake-AI
Snake AI using a Hamiltonian Cycle. \
This follows from the CodeBullet video in which I will try to recreate what he made.\
This will be done by creating a Hamiltonian Cycle for a grid on the screen and having the snake traverse this grid.\
The end result is quite a simple program. Find a Hamiltonian Cycle and follow it. I could make improvements to it so
that is can make shortcuts and jumps which could be interesting.
